I did this through the integration of machine learning models and the tensor flow library to automate the econometrics forecasting of their Southwest Branch.  There was push back the entire time I was at the company ins 2019 to 2024 from the executive vice president Mr. Murphy but through a long series of engagement and McKinsey proposal strategies and partnerships I was able to get him to my side.  Rising through ranks quickly with 6 promotions in 3 years."
